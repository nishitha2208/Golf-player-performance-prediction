# Golf-player-performance-prediction
Explore more on attribute selection to have perfect fit model  and compare the results. We ran through different regression models and compare  the accuracy of each. We also used use logistic regression to predict if the player is a potential  winner or not. Performance Prediction Part of the challenge of this project will be to create suitable metrics that  accurately describe an association which is pertinent to the problem to be solved, for example  predicting if a golfer will miss the cut or not. This will be a significant part of the experiment and  the identification of key metrics, either derived or transformed from the source data, or the original  data items, will be the key to success of the experiments.
